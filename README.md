## Justin Nguyen's Personal Website

This is the website I will be using to talk about myself, my background, and my work in machine learning, software development, and data science.

This website is created from scratch without any templates, although I have taken inspiration from other portfolios in my own implementation.  It is written in HTML, CSS, a small bit of JavaScript, and some SCSS for better organization of the styling.
